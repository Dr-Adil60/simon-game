## ***Simon Game***
The Simon game is a memory game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors in the same order in which they flashed. The sequence grows longer with each successful round, and the player must click on the colors in the correct order to continue. This version of the game is built using HTML and JavaScript.

## ***Features***
Color sequence: The game flashes a sequence of colors randomly.
Memory challenge: The player must repeat the sequence by clicking on the colors in the correct order.
Game progression: Each successful round adds one more color to the sequence, making the game more challenging.
Event listeners: The game uses event listeners to detect user input and trigger actions.
Game Flash Function: The flashing of colors in the game sequence is handled by a dedicated flash function.
Press any key to start: The game starts when any key is pressed, providing an interactive start screen.
No backend: The game runs entirely on the client-side with no database or external storage. Data resets when the page is refreshed.


## ***Technologies Used***

Once the game starts, the game will flash a sequence of colors.

If you get the sequence correct, the game will add another color to the sequence and repeat the process.
If you click the wrong color, the game ends, and the sequence starts over.
